LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN courses c
ON e.course_id = c.course_id;


2. Find all courses that currently have no students enrolled.

SELECT c.course_name
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON c.course_id = e.course_id
WHERE e.student_id IS NULL;


3. Display all instructors and the courses they teach, including instructors who are not assigned to any course.

SELECT i.instructor_name, c.course_name
FROM instructors i
LEFT JOIN courses c
ON i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id;

5. Display all students and enrollment information using a RIGHT JOIN.

SELECT s.student_name, e.course_id
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id;


6. Find students who are not enrolled in any course.

SELECT s.student_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id
WHERE e.course_id IS NULL;


7. Use a FULL OUTER JOIN to display all students and enrollments, including unmatched rows from both tables.

SELECT s.student_name, e.course_id
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id
UNION
SELECT s.student_name, e.course_id
FROM students s
RIGHT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id;


8. Find all courses that have never appeared in the enrollments table.

SELECT c.course_name
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON c.course_id = e.course_id
WHERE e.course_id IS NULL;


9. Display all instructors and courses using a FULL OUTER JOIN and identify unmatched rows.

SELECT i.instructor_name, c.course_name
FROM instructors i
LEFT JOIN courses c
ON i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id
UNION
SELECT i.instructor_name, c.course_name
FROM instructors i
RIGHT JOIN courses c
ON i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id;


10. Create a report showing: student name, course name, and instructor name. Include rows even if course or instructor information is missing.

SELECT s.student_name,
       c.course_name,
       i.instructor_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN courses c
ON e.course_id = c.course_id
LEFT JOIN instructors i
ON c.instructor_id = i.instructor_id;
